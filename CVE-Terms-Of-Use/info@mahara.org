  This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at https://iwantacve.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use (assuming you filled out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the data until you accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use). 
  
  Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add it to the DWF MITRE CVE Terms of Use acceptance data at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/master/Terms-Of-Use
  
  If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this message, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don't want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to the block list so we don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically in future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list with no problems.
