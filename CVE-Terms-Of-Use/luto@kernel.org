please do not submit it, setup an email address and use that. I cannot
comply with GDPR requests to remove your information due to the nature of
git, and my inability to confirm if you are a european or not, so if you
don't want it in there, don't reply with "I accept".

want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME
THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to the block list so
we don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from
being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically
in future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea
what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list
with no problems.
