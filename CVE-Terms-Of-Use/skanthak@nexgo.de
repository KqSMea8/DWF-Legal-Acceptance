Subject: DWF/CVE - Acceptance of MITRE Terms of Use for CVE for skanthak@nexgo.de


> This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at https://iwantacve.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use
(assuming you filled out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the data until you accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use).
>
> Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add a copy of
the email to the DWF MITRE CVE Terms of Use acceptance data at
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/master/Terms-Of-Use
>
> The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an artifact showing that the email address accepted the Terms
of Use, when they were accepted and so on.
>
> If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this message, however we may resend it at some point in the
future, if you don't want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add
your email address to the block list so we don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from being able to
accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically in future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea
what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list with no problems.
