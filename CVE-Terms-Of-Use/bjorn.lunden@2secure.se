This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at https://iwantacv=
e.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use (assuming you filled=
 out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the data until you accept the =
MITRE CVE Terms of Use).=20

Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to=
 the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add it to the DWF MITRE CVE Terms o=
f Use acceptance data at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-L=
egal-Acceptance/tree/master/Terms-Of-Use

If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this m=
essage, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don't =
want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME TH=
IS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to the block list so w=
e don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from be=
ing able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically in =
future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea what a=
 CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list with no =
problems.=20
