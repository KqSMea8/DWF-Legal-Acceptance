I accept

Le 6 avril 2017 =C3=A0 22:16:51, kurt@seifried.org (kurt@seifried.org) a =
=C3=A9crit:

This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at
https://iwantacve.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use
(assuming you filled out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the data
until you accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use).

Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to
the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add it to the DWF MITRE CVE Terms of
Use acceptance data at
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/mast=
er/Terms-Of-Use

If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this
message, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don't
want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME
THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to the block list so
we don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from
being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically
in future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea
what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list
with no problems.
