Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to
the
MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add a copy of the email to the DWF MITRE
CVE
Terms of Use acceptance data at
[2]https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/m=
ast[..]

The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an
artifact
showing that the email address accepted the Terms of Use, when they were
accepted
and so on.

If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this
message,
however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don't want any
future
emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER
AGAIN"
and I'll add your email address to the block list so we don't spam you with
these,
please note that this will prevent you from being able to accept the MITRE
CVE
Terms of Use via the DWF automatically in future (you'll have to manually
ask).
But again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to
be
added to the block list with no problems.
