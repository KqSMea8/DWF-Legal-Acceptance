Subject: DWF/CVE - Acceptance of MITRE Terms of Use for CVE for =
bazy@safecomp.com

This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at =
https://iwantacve.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use =
(assuming you filled out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the =
data until you accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use).=20

Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree =
to the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add it to the DWF MITRE CVE =
Terms of Use acceptance data at =
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/ma=
ster/Terms-Of-Use

If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore =
this message, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if =
you don't want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or =
"DON'T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to =
the block list so we don't spam you with these, please note that this =
will prevent you from being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use =
via the DWF automatically in future (you'll have to manually ask). But =
again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to =
be added to the block list with no problems.=20
