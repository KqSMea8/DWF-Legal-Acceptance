If you are concerned about your personal information (in the form of your email address and any attached information you include like your name) please do not submit it, setup an email address and use that. I cannot comply with GDPR requests to remove your information due to the nature of git, and my inability to confirm if you are a european or not, so if you don't want it in there, don't reply with "I accept".

But again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list with no problems.
