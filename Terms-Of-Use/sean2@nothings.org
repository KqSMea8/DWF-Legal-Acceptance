<blockquote type=3Dcite class=3Dcite cite=3D"">This is a confirmation ema=
il
sent from CVE request form at
<a href=3D"https://iwantacve.org/" eudora=3D"autourl">
https://iwantacve.org/</a> asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of
Use (assuming you filled out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the
data until you accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use). <br><br>
Simply quote the email and reply with &quot;I accept&quot; at the top if
you agree to the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add a copy of the
email to the DWF MITRE CVE Terms of Use acceptance data at
<a href=3D"https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Accepta=
nce/tree/master/Terms-Of-Use" eudora=3D"autourl">
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/ma=
ster/Terms-Of-Use</a>
<br><br>
The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an
artifact showing that the email address accepted the Terms of Use, when
they were accepted and so on. <br><br>
If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this
message, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you
don't want any future emails simply reply with &quot;unsubscribe&quot; or
&quot;DON'T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN&quot; and I'll add your email
address to the block list so we don't spam you with these, please note
that this will prevent you from being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms
of Use via the DWF automatically in future (you'll have to manually ask).
But again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/ask
to be added to the block list with no problems. <br><br>
