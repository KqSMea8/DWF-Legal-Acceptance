<br>
Simply quote the email and reply with &quot;I accept&quot; at the top if yo=
u agree to the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add a copy of the email t=

<br>
The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an artif=
act showing that the email address accepted the Terms of Use, when they wer=
e accepted and so on. <br>
<br>
If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this m=
essage, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don&#3=
9;t want any future emails simply reply with &quot;unsubscribe&quot; or &qu=
ot;DON&#39;T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN&quot; and I&#39;ll add your emai=
l address to the block list so we don&#39;t spam you with these, please not=
e that this will prevent you from being able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms =
of Use via the DWF automatically in future (you&#39;ll have to manually ask=
). But again, if you have no idea what a CVE is then you can ignore this/as=
k to be added to the block list with no problems. <br>
