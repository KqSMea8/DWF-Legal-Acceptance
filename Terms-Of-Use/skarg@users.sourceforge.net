The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an artif=
act showing that the email address accepted the Terms of Use, when they wer=

<br>
This data cannot be removed from the Internet, or from our git repo. If you=
 are concerned about your personal information (in the form of your email a=
ddress and any attached information you include like your name) please do n=
ot submit it, setup an email address and use that. I cannot comply with GDP=
R requests to remove your information due to the nature of git, and my inab=
ility to confirm if you are a european or not, so if you don&#39;t want it =
in there, don&#39;t reply with &quot;I accept&quot;. <br>
<br>
If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this m=
essage, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don&#3=

ot;DON&#39;T SEND ME THIS EMAIL EVER AGAIN&quot; and I&#39;ll add your emai=
