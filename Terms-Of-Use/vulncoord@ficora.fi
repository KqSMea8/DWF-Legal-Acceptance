Subject: DWF/CVE - Acceptance of MITRE Terms of Use for CVE for vulncoord@f=
icora.fi

This is a confirmation email sent from CVE request form at https://iwantacv=
e.org/ asking you to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use (assuming you filled=
 out the CVE form and want one, we can't use the data until you accept the =
MITRE CVE Terms of Use).=20

Simply quote the email and reply with "I accept" at the top if you agree to=
 the MITRE CVE Terms of Use and we will add a copy of the email to the DWF =
MITRE CVE Terms of Use acceptance data at https://github.com/distributedwea=
knessfiling/DWF-Legal-Acceptance/tree/master/Terms-Of-Use

The reason we use a complete copy of the email is that it provides an artif=
act showing that the email address accepted the Terms of Use, when they wer=
e accepted and so on.=20

This data cannot be removed from the Internet, or from our git repo. If you=
 are concerned about your personal information (in the form of your email a=
ddress and any attached information you include like your name) please do n=
ot submit it, setup an email address and use that. I cannot comply with GDP=
R requests to remove your information due to the nature of git, and my inab=
ility to confirm if you are a european or not, so if you don't want it in t=
here, don't reply with "I accept".=20

If you did not submit a CVE request to the DWF you can safely ignore this m=
essage, however we may resend it at some point in the future, if you don't =
want any future emails simply reply with "unsubscribe" or "DON'T SEND ME TH=
IS EMAIL EVER AGAIN" and I'll add your email address to the block list so w=
e don't spam you with these, please note that this will prevent you from be=
ing able to accept the MITRE CVE Terms of Use via the DWF automatically in =
future (you'll have to manually ask). But again, if you have no idea what a=
 CVE is then you can ignore this/ask to be added to the block list with no =
problems.=20
